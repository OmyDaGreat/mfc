= KotlinScriptTemplate

A template for creating Kotlin command-line applications with automated GitHub releases and Scoop package publishing.

== Overview

This template provides a simple structure for Kotlin applications with:

- Single Kotlin source file
- Batch file for easy execution
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases
- Scoop manifest generation and publishing

== Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Kotlin 2.1.10
- Git

== Getting Started

1. Clone this template repository:
+
[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/KotlinScriptTemplate.git
cd KotlinScriptTemplate
----

2. Modify the `Runner.kt` file with your application logic.

3. Build the project:
+
[source]
----
kotlinc Runner.kt -include-runtime -d build/runner.jar
----

4. Run the application:
+
[source]
----
runner.bat hello
----

== Customizing the Template

1. Rename the main Kotlin file from `Runner.kt` to your application name.
2. Update the batch file name from `runner.bat` to match your application.
3. Edit `.kommit.yaml` to customize commit message types and scopes as needed.

== Configuring Automated Releases

Update the environment variables in `.github/workflows/release.yml.tmp` (and remove its `.tmp` extension):

[source,yaml]
----
env:
  KT_NAME: YourAppName          # Main Kotlin file name (without .kt)
  APP_NAME: yourappname         # Name for compiled app (lowercase)
  REPO_LOCATION: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YourRepository
  BUCKET_LOCATION: YOUR-USERNAME/YourBucket
  BUCKET_NAME: yourbucket
  DESCRIPTION: Your application description
  JAVA_VERSION: '21'           # Required Java version
  KOTLIN_VERSION: '2.1.10'     # Required Kotlin version
----

== Setting Up Scoop Publishing

1. Create a Scoop bucket repository if you don't have one.

2. Create a Personal Access Token with `repo` permissions in GitHub:
- Go to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
- Generate a new token with `repo` scope
- Copy the token

3. Add the token as a repository secret:
- Go to your repository settings
- Select "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
- Add a new secret named `REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your token

4. Add the workflow file to your Scoop bucket repository:
- Create a file at `.github/workflows/update-runner.yml` in your bucket repository
- Copy the content from `update-runner.yml.tmp` in this template
- Update the environment variables to match your application settings
+
[source,yaml]
----
env:
  KT_NAME: YourAppName          # Main Kotlin file name (without .kt)
  APP_NAME: yourappname         # Name for compiled app (lowercase)
  REPO_LOCATION: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YourRepository
  BUCKET_LOCATION: YOUR-USERNAME/YourBucket
  BUCKET_NAME: yourbucket
  DESCRIPTION: Your application description
  JAVA_VERSION: '21'
  KOTLIN_VERSION: '2.1.10'
----

5. When a new release is created, the workflow will:
- Build your application
- Package it as a ZIP
- Create a GitHub release
- Generate a Scoop manifest
- Send a dispatch event to your Scoop bucket repository
- The bucket repository will automatically update with the new version information

== Manual Version Bumps

Trigger a manual release with a specific version bump:

1. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Select the "Build and Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose version bump type: patch, minor, or major

== Commit Message Convention

This project uses a customizable commit convention defined in `.kommit.yaml`:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- chore: Other changes
